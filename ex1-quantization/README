1. imReadAndConvert.m - Converts RGB image to grayscale.
						(1) indicates a grayscale image, (2) indicates a RGB image.
2. imDisplay.m - Displays a picture returned from imReadAndConvert with coordinates
				 and pixel intensity information.
3. transformRGB2YIQ.m - Transforms a RGB image to YIQ.

5. histogramEqualize.m - Calculates an image's histogram, an image after a histogram
						 equalization and its histogram.
6. quantizeImage.m  - Quantizes an image into nQuants.
7. testImg1.jpg - a test image (3 colors).
8. testImg2.jpg - a test image (rainbow colors).

Notes:
-----
Since we try to partition z(i) so that every bin will have approximately the same numer of pixels in
it, there might be some errors in cases like:

Histogram:              1   1   1   1   1   100000000
Cumulative sum:         1   2   3   4   5   100000005
Normelized cumulative:  0   0   0   0   0   255

In this example we can't divide the initial bins equally since there is much more of the last color,
and if we assume approx. the same number of colors for each bin we can only divide it into 2 bins
(one for all of the first colors and the second for the last color).
